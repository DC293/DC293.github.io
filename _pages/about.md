I am a researcher and engineer specialising in sports technologies and equipment. In my current position 
as Research and Insights Manager at the International Tennis Federation I assist the development of test 
programmes to protect the integrity of the game. Previously, I worked with FIFA to develop standards for
football surfaces guided by player perceptions. 

I obtained a BSc in Sports Technology (2015) prior to completing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering (2020) at Loughborough University. 
My thesis focused on using numerical modelling of sports surfaces to optimise specific performance parameters.  

I utilise data science methods to process, analyse and present data to monitor the state of play and help guide standards. 
I use this blog to portfolio projects and demonstate the power of data science in sport.
