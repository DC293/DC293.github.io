I am a researcher and engineer specialising in technologies and equipment in sport. In my current position 
as Research and Insights Manager at the [International Tennis Federation](https://www.itftennis.com/en/about-us/tennis-tech/innovation/) I assist the development of test 
programmes to protect the integrity of the game. Previously, I worked with FIFA to [develop standards](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2022/june/loughborough-collaborates-with-fifa/) for football surfaces guided by player perceptions. 

I obtained a BSc in Sports Technology (2015) prior to completing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering (2020) at Loughborough University's [Sports Technology Institute](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/sti). My [thesis](https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Numerical_modelling_of_3G_artificial_turf_under_vertical_loading/11892084?file=21811026) focused on using numerical modelling of sports surfaces to optimise specific performance parameters.  

I utilise data science methods to process, analyse and present data. 
I use this blog to portfolio projects and demonstrate the power of data science in sport.
